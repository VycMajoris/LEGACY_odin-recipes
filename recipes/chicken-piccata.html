    <h2>Description</h2>

    <label for="Step1"><strong>Step 1</strong></label>

    <p>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</p>
    <label for="Step2"><strong>Step 2</strong></label>
    <p>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</p>
    <label for="Step3"><strong>Step 3</strong></label>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</p>
    <label for="Step4"><strong>Step 4</strong></label>
    <p>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</p>
    <label for="Step5"><strong>Step 5</strong></label>
    <p>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</p>
    <label for="Step6"><strong>Step 6</strong></label>
    <p>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</p>
    <label for="Step7"><strong>Step 7</strong></label>
    <p>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</p>
